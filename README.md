# Practical Machine Learning and Image Processing Examples

This repository contains practical examples from the book "Practical Machine Learning and Image Processing" by Himanshu Singh. The examples cover various topics in image processing and machine learning using the scikit-image library and OpenCV.

## Basic of scikit-image

The "Basic of scikit-image" example provides a beginner-level introduction to the scikit-image library. It covers fundamental image processing operations like loading an image, displaying an image, and performing basic manipulations.

## Color Space Conversion using OpenCV

The "Color Space Conversion using OpenCV" example demonstrates how to convert images between different color spaces using OpenCV. It includes code snippets and explanations for converting images to HSV, LAB, and other color spaces.

## Changing Contrast and Brightness

The "Changing Contrast and Brightness" example shows how to adjust the contrast and brightness of an image using scikit-image. It includes code snippets and explanations to help you understand the process of enhancing image quality through contrast and brightness adjustments.

## Gamma Correction

The "Gamma Correction" example illustrates how to perform gamma correction on images using scikit-image. Gamma correction is a technique used to adjust the brightness levels of an image and is often employed in various image processing applications.

## Image Thresholding

The "Image Thresholding" example covers image thresholding techniques using scikit-image. Thresholding is used to convert grayscale images into binary images by setting a threshold value to segment objects from the background.

## Smoothing Images

The "Smoothing Images" example demonstrates various image smoothing techniques using scikit-image. Image smoothing is used to reduce noise and remove fine details, resulting in a more simplified image.

## SIFT Feature Extraction using OpenCV

The "SIFT Feature Extraction using OpenCV" example showcases how to extract SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) features from images using OpenCV. SIFT is a popular technique for detecting and describing key points in an image.

## SSIM - Structural Similarity Index Measure

The "SSIM - Structural Similarity Index Measure" example explains how to use SSIM to compare the similarity between images. SSIM is a metric that measures the structural similarity between two images and is commonly used in image quality assessment.

## Different Machine Learning Models on Digit-Recognizer Pixel Values

The "Different Machine Learning Models on Digit-Recognizer Pixel Values" example explores various machine learning models applied to the digit-recognizer dataset using pixel values as features. It covers models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, etc.

## Deep Learning on Digit-Recognizer Pixel Values using DNN and CNN

The "Deep Learning on Digit-Recognizer Pixel Values using DNN and CNN" example demonstrates how to apply deep learning techniques, specifically Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), on the digit-recognizer dataset with pixel values.
